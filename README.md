# 🌐 LangChain LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) 🚀

LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a powerful tool for creating dynamic, interactive templates and expressions in LangChain. With LCEL, you can add logic and flexibility to your language models, making it easier to build intelligent, adaptable responses for chatbots, question-answering systems, and other AI applications. 🎉

## 📚 Overview

LangChain's LCEL provides a way to define templates and expressions that adapt based on variables, conditions, and user inputs. LCEL gives you control to structure responses based on context, dynamically manage prompts, and implement logic directly within templates.

### 🤔 Why Use LCEL?

- **Dynamic Responses**: Customize prompts and outputs based on changing conditions, creating a conversational flow that feels more natural and responsive.
- **Condition-Based Logic**: Use expressions to apply conditions, loops, and calculations within templates, making responses intelligent and adaptable.
- **Streamlined Interaction**: Reduce the complexity of integrating multiple tools by embedding logic directly in your LangChain templates.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔄 **Dynamic Prompts**: Make your prompts responsive by using expressions that adapt to user data.
- 🧠 **Conditionals & Logic**: LCEL allows you to add `if` conditions, loops, and other logical structures to your templates.
- 💡 **Enhanced Flexibility**: Integrate complex operations and variables without needing external scripting, keeping your LangChain setup clean and efficient.

## 💻 Usage

LCEL allows you to create templates that include expressions, logical operators, and variables. Here’s a quick example:

```python
from langchain.lcel import Template

template_str = """
Hello, {{user_name}}! 👋

{% if user_role == "admin" %}
    As an admin, you have full access to all resources. 🔐
{% else %}
    Your role is {{user_role}}, so your access is limited. 🚫
{% endif %}
"""

template = Template(template_str)
output = template.render(user_name="Alice", user_role="admin")
print(output)
```

### 📝 Example Scenarios

1. **Customer Support Chatbots**: Provide different responses based on the user's input, account status, or query type.
2. **Personalized Recommendations**: Customize recommendations by dynamically inserting product information or user preferences.
3. **FAQ Systems**: Show different information based on the query type or user history.
